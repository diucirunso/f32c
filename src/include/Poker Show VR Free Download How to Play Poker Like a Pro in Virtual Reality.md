## How to Cheat in Poker Show VR
 
The cheat we are going to use is based on a software called Cheat Engine, which is a tool that allows you to modify the memory of any running process on your computer. You can use it to change the values of variables, such as your chips, cards, or bets. You can download Cheat Engine for free from [here](https://www.cheatengine.org/).
 
Once you have installed Cheat Engine, follow these steps to cheat in Poker Show VR:
 
1. Launch Poker Show VR and join a table.
2. Alt-tab to your desktop and open Cheat Engine.
3. Select the Poker Show VR process from the list of processes.
4. In the Value Type dropdown menu, select Double.
5. In the Value box, enter the amount of chips you have in the game.
6. Click on First Scan and wait for the results.
7. Go back to the game and either win or lose some chips.
8. Alt-tab to Cheat Engine again and enter your new chip amount in the Value box.
9. Click on Next Scan and wait for the results.
10. You should see one or a few addresses in the left panel. Select them all and click on the red arrow to add them to the bottom panel.
11. In the bottom panel, double-click on each value and change it to whatever amount you want. For example, you can change it to 9999999.
12. Go back to the game and enjoy your unlimited chips.

You can also use Cheat Engine to change your cards or your bets, but be careful not to make it too obvious or you might raise suspicion from other players or the game developers. Also, remember to turn off Cheat Engine when you are done playing or you might get detected by anti-cheat software.
 
## Conclusion
 
Poker Show VR is a fun and realistic way to play poker in virtual reality, but if you want to cheat and win more chips, you can use Cheat Engine to modify the game's memory. However, cheating is not recommended as it can ruin the game for others and get you banned. So use this cheat at your own risk and discretion.
